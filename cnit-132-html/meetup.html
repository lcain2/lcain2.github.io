  <p>The presentation was put on by <a href="https://www.a11ytalks.com" target="_blank">A11y Talks (Accessibility Talks)</a>, which is a virtual meetup group that features speakers and conversations around the topic of digital accessibility. The organization streams live meetups roughly once a month. Their <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/4/r?cid=dGVhbUBhMTF5dGFsa3MuY29t" target="_blank">google calendar</a> is a handy way to know what events are coming up.</p>
  <p>From this video I learned a lot about the importance of accessibility for websites, and how beneficial it is to incorporate accessible code from the beginning of a project, rather than trying to change it later, which can be costly and time consuming.</p> 
  <p>While I have some experience with accessibility as a designer, I do not have much knowledge when it comes to code, so I was most interested in the portion about tips for developers. The video went over these best practices: using semantic HTML, using &lt;details&gt; for accordions, and how to properly code forms (structure, styling and error handling). They also included some information about how to test your site, and resources for learning more, such as <a href="https://www.wuhcag.com/" target="_blank">wuhcag.com</a></p>
  <p>Overall I thought this was a good introduction to digital accessibility. I plan to watch more videos from A11y Talks so I can learn about accessible code in greater detail.</p>
