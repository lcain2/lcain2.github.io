  <!-- 5. The miniproject1.html page should have an image of you - think about this page as a homepage to introduce yourself to CNIT 132 class and to other web developers. The image should not be too big - around 150px in width and height. -->

    <!-- 6. Write a paragraph about yourself. It can be below the image - you should not worry about the layout. -->
    <p>Hello, my name is Leslie Cain. I am originally from Massachusetts, spent 8 years in NYC, and have lived in SF for 13 years. I enjoy cooking, camping, hiking, and going on road trips.</p> 
    <!-- 7. You will write another paragraph that will talk about your path in the web development field and you will insert a link to your favorite page/website. Do not only insert the link but also talk a little bit about this site (why is it your favorite or one of your favorite sites?). This link should open in another tab/window -->
    <p>I have a professional background in design & UX, mainly doing website builds. Throughout my career I have aslo worked with HTML and CSS/SASS to style my designs in the browser and fine tune the responsive design. I am currently pursuing the Frontend Web Development Certificate at City College so that I can expand my skills in other frontend technologies such as JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Because I have a strong interest in User Experience, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank">Nielsen Norman Group</a> is a website that I visit frequently. There is so much to learn there, and their resources and articles are always interesting and well researched.</p>
    <p>If you would like to learn about the history of web development at the turn of the century, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the_turn_of_the_century" target="_blank">A Brief History of Web Development</a>.</p>

    <h2>Web Development Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> is a fantastic resource for all types of web development. This is my go-to reference when I need a quick run-down of anything related to HTML, CSS or JavaScript.</li>
      <li>For HTML validation, I use <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Validator</a>. I like the flexibility of being able to validate by URL, html file, or direct input.</li>
      <li><a href="https://webaim.org" target="_blank">WebAIM</a> is the main resource I use for information about accessibility. Their <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">Color Contrast Checker</a> is a tool that I use on a daily basis to ensure the webpages I'm designing have acceptable contrast levels.</li>
