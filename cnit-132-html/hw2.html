  <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SEO stands for <em>Search Engine Optimization</em>.</strong> It is the process of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engines such as <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Improving your search ranking brings more <em>organic traffic</em> to your webpage,</strong> meaning the higher up your ranking, the more people are likely to click through to your website. </li>
    <li><strong>Understanding <em>how</em> search engines rank is the key to SEO.</strong> Search engines crawl the web, index webpages and analyze their code to assess a webpage's relevance and quality. Following best practices for SEO will increase the likelihood that your webpage will be seen as relevant and trustworthy. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Best Practices for Search Engine Optimization</h2>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Research the keywords your target audience is using, and work them into the content in ways that are meaningful and logical.</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Optimize the meta description tags in the page head to accurately reflect the content on the page and reiterate the keywords that are most relevant. You should also implement open graph meta tags, which provide the preview content when your URL is shared on social media. </li>
    <li><strong> Title Tag:</strong> Create a concise and informative page title that will help search bots understand the purpose of the webpage.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Structure:</strong> Use headers (h1, h2, h3 etc.) give structure and hierarchy to your content. This helps search bots know what content is most important.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Quality:</strong> Writing content that is unique and high-quality will increase the chances that search bots will see it as valuable and trustworthy.</li>
    <li><strong>Images:</strong> Images should have clear descriptive file names, and should include descriptive alt text in the code. Also make sure images are optimized for the web so that they load quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Site Structure:</strong> Create a logical navigation with accurate and concise URLs that both users and search bots can easily understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Backlinks:</strong> Find ways to get your URL linked from other trustworthy websites to build credibility.</li>
   </ul>
