  <h2>The Benefits of Hybrid Applications</h2>
  <p>Hybrid applications offer a lot of advantages. They allow developers to build a single code base and deploy it across multiple platforms. Hybrid apps are built using common web technologies such as HTML and JavaScript, which leads to faster, more cost effective development, and simplified updates. After analyzing our needs with the team, we have concluded that using hybrid application techniques is the right approach for our upcoming app build. Below, we will compare three commonly used platforms to see which is the best fit for our needs. 

  <h2>PhoneGap</h2>
  <p>PhoneGap, also known as Cordova, is a well known HTML5 based solution maintained by Adobe up until 2020. PhoneGap is relatively easy to learn and offers a large selection of plugins, but the lack of a UI library makes it less likely to look and feel like a native app. Because support for PhoneGap has ended, we are hesitant to recommend it.
  </p>
  <h2>React Native</h2>
  <p>React Native is a popular tool built by Facebook and used by other major companies. It uses React's component-based system to build user interfaces using native components. This approach provides an experience that is closer to the look and feel of a native app. This tool may have a slightly higher learning curve, and the dependence on native components could add some complexity, but React Native's popularity and large library make it a strong choice for our project.
  </p>
  <h2>Flutter</h2>
  <p>Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework. Like React Native, Flutter also has an extensive UI library, but it differs in that is has its own rendering engine, Dart. This allows Flutter to achieve high performance and consistent UI across platforms without relying on native components. Flutter is not quite as established as React Native, but community around it is strong and growing. It offers a powerful and unique developer experience and good performance, but the learning curve may be higher. 
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Considering our specific project requirements, team expertise, timeline and future vision for our app, we recommend React Native. Its proven reliability and strong community will be an asset for us going forward.
