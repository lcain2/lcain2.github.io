  <h1>Silver & Gold: A Progressive Web Application</h1>

  <h2>What is a Progressive Web Application</h2>
  <p>A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a web-based app that provides a user experience that is similar to a platform-specific app you might download from an app store. They are built using a combination of technologies that allow it to have better performance, availability, and reliability than a traditional website. 
  </p>
  <h2>Characteristics of a Progressive Web Application</h2>
  <p>The major advantage of a PWA is that it uses standard web technologies that work on many types of operating systems and devices. This allows the builder to have a single code base, instead of having separate platform-specific apps. It is fully responsive and uses progressive enhancement to make sure that it will work on all devices in some capacity. For the user, the experience is similar to a transitional app. PWAs can be downloaded through a web browser or an app store and installed on a user's device, where they can then access it through an app icon. The installation process downloads all of the necessary files to run the app without an internet connection. PWAs can also run background tasks and leverage device features such as push notifications. 
  </p>

  <h2>Service-worker.js file</h2>
  <p>You will also create a service-worker.js file in order to make that PWA page work even when the user is offline - even the change of the background image should be able to work as the images would also be cached! Tip: remember to cache all the files that make your web application work: the HTML page, the CSS, the images you are using, etc.</p>

  <h2>Extra Credit</h2>
  <p>You will create on the same web page an input box (do not forget to include the label tag for that input box) where the user will type his/her name.</p>
  <p>As soon as the user finishes typing his/her name, you will have a small JavaScript program to check the Local Storage of the page to see if there is a "name" key (you can use the value of "name" for the key of the Local Storage) in the Local Storage. If there is not, it means that you need to save the name typed by the user in the Local Storage. But in either case, you will update part of the paragraph below the input box to show the name that has been retrieved from the Local Storage.</p>
