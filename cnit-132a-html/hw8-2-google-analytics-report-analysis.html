    <h2>Website Traffic Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      For this final assignment, I created a custom <a href="https://analytics.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> report to better understand the traffic coming to my website from January to May, 2024. To build this report, I started with the Engagement Overview report, and then used the “Customize Report” option to remove the less relevant data, and add new data points that gave me information about my site visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of those five months, my website received 379 page views which were distributed between 4 webpages on my site (Home and Welcome in this list both represent the homepage.) It's important to note that because some of the homework pages did not have my standard website header, those pages did not have the GA code installed and unfortunately views to those pages were not recorded. This was obviously a disappointing oversight on my part and one that I have now corrected. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      The first half of the report focuses on Views and Engagement while the second half focuses on the Technology used to visit the site. Some of the more interesting data points are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The spike in views and engagement time in February represents the public launch of the website when it was posted to the class forum. At this time, the site was interacted with more often and for a longer period of time per session, bringing the overall average up.</li>
      <li>My Homepage and Assignments page had the most views, and the number of views is nearly equal. When I looked deeper and explored the paths users took throughout the site, almost all of the visits to the homepage were followed by a visit to the Assignments page.</li>
      <li>Although the technology portion is not necessarily related to what users are doing on the site, I thought it was important to check in on the platforms, devices, and browsers that visitors are using, to ensure that the website is optimized and working properly for all users. The large majority of users are viewing on desktop screens from safari and chrome browsers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>SEO Insights & Improvements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Stay Organized and Consistent:</strong> A good site structure and consistency with my process will ensure that all of my pages have the Google Analytics code installed and all pages will be tracked.</li>
      <li><strong>Test the Tracking Code:</strong> For every page launched on the site, run a test to make sure GA is properly tracking the page.</li>
      <li><strong>Check & Analyze Data Regularly:</strong> Even though I logged in and looked at the data throughout the semester, I was failing to analyze it. Big overview numbers are often interesting and eye-catching, but It’s important to look closely at the data to look for potential issues with your tracking and SEO.</li>
    </ol>
