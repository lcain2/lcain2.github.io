        <h3>Free Keyword Research Tools</h3>
        <p>As this was my first time researching keywords, I tried out several free or free-trial keyword research tools to see which one would give me the most useful results. Here’s a list of the research tools I tried:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/keywords" target="_blank">Wordstream</a></dt>
          <dd>Wordstream is a free tool that provides keyword suggestions based on your suggested keyword or website URL. The search form also has fields to choose your relevant industry (optional) or state/country (required.) The quality of the results seemed to be lacking with this tool, as it gave keywords that were sometimes strange or too specific. The listing gave a few stats with each word such as search volume and competition level, however I was skeptical that the stats were accurate. For example, most keywords were marked as “low” competition level, even if they were very generic and highly searched words.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="http://Keywordtool.io" target="_blank">Keyword Tool</a></dt>
          <dd>Keyword Tool offers a free version and a paid Pro version. This tool allows you to research a keyword with options to enter a country or language, and the most unique thing about this service is that you can customize the search for 12 different platforms such as Google, YouTube, Amazon and TikTok. The free version gives you a long list of potential keywords (my search had 400+ results) but does not offer any additional stats or information. 
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="https://mangools.com/" target="_blank">Mangools</a></dt>
          <dd>Mangools is a paid SEO service that offers a free 7-day trial if you create an account with a valid email address. With the free trial, it provides a list of about 20 keyword suggestions. For each keyword, the listing shows a set of helpful stats for each word: search volume trend, keyword interest growth, average monthly search volume, cost per click, level of competition, and keyword SEO difficulty. Mangools provided more relevant suggestions than the two free options above and the stats looked reliable.
          </dd>
          <dt><a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Gemini</a></dt>
          <dd>Gemini provides a smaller list of results, but the quality of information provided was highest. Gemini broke down the suggestions into three categories: High-volume keywords, Mid-volume keywords, and Long-tail keywords. It provided 3 keyword options for each category, and gave an explanation as to why it suggested those words. Not all of the suggestions were relevant, but the extra information it provided was helpful in learning more about SEO and sparked ideas for additional keywords.
